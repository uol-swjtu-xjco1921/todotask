# todotask
An example of the to-do list tracker task from 27/03 lecture.

This is probably a bit more code-y than others.

This version also considers memory allocation and how we would use dynamic memory - you may have done this with static allocation.

You will note that:

I have tried to make some functions more reusable (display_bool and get_choice especially)
I have functions even though I only do things once - keeping my code better separated
My breakdown isn't the only possible option, you could do this in many different ways :)
